# Fake-News-Detector

This project focuses on building a fake news detector using different machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision tree classification, gradient boosting classifier, and random forest classifier. It utilizes two datasetsâ€”one containing true news and the other containing false news. The project involves data preprocessing using PySpark and Pandas, followed by model training and prediction.

Features:

Fake news detection: Identify whether a news article is genuine or fake using various machine learning models.
Data preprocessing: Clean and transform the raw datasets using PySpark and Pandas to prepare them for training.
Model training: Utilize logistic regression, decision tree classification, gradient boosting classifier, and random forest classifier to train the models on the preprocessed data.
Prediction: Apply the trained models to make predictions on new news articles and classify them as true or false.
